1. Try to avoid copies on the generic example. Using refs will not allow us to have RegPassable types since those don't have pointers.
2. Try to expand VariadicList or VariadicPack, to allow graph flattening.
3. try to use generic in async, rewriting asyncrt to have types in the outputs for TaskGroup. Might be tricky because it will need to have the point 1 to get as an output, a tuple of distinct types.
Hi @zyx-billy , I think the issue still exists in the current nightly, but it's good to know that it will be something considered as per design or isn't considered an issue. Something like `fn __init__[s](out self: SW[t, t.s])` successfully infers `s` to `t.s`. If my example should not work, then the example with a simple parameter should not work too, but it's working.
